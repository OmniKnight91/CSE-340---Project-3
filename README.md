# CSE-340---Project-3
The goal is to write a predictive parser and write a type checker for a given language. The parser
checks the syntax of the input and the type checker enforces the semantic rules of the language. The
semantic rules that we are interested in specify which assignments are valid and which expressions are
valid.

Was able to complete the first half of the project which involves the parser to be 100% correct and completed.  The 2nd half had numerous bugs and some incomplete code which was not addressed due to time constraints.
